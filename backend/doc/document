Here's a brief explanation of the buildMedicineSearchQuery function based on the database structure and its purpose:

ðŸ“„ Functionality Overview: buildMedicineSearchQuery(params)
This function dynamically builds a parameterized SQL query to search for medicines stored in a PostgreSQL database. It is designed to support:

Multiple Filters
Users can filter medicine records by:

medicine_name, brand_name, batch_no

invoice_id, invoice_no

purchase_price, mrp

payment_status, payment_date

wholesaler_name

âœ… New: invoice_date_from and invoice_date_to for date-range filtering

Joins Between Tables
It uses SQL JOINs across three related tables:

medicine_stock (medicine data)

invoices (invoice and payment info)

wholesalers (supplier/wholesaler details)

Secure Query Building

Uses parameterized queries ($1, $2, ...) to avoid SQL injection.

Parameters are collected in a values[] array and returned with the query string.

Pagination & Sorting Support

Pagination using limit and offset values.

Sorting with optional order_by (e.g., by medicine_name, expiry_date) and order_dir (ASC/DESC).

Flexible Search

Partial matching via ILIKE for case-insensitive search (%value%).

Numerical and date filters via exact match or range (e.g., price, invoice_date_from/to).

âœ… Example Use Case:
A user wants to search for Paracetamol from wholesaler "Medilife", between invoice dates 2024-01-01 and 2024-06-30, and sort by expiry date descending.

The API would call:

Edit
GET /api/medicines?medicine_name=paracetamol&wholesaler_name=medilife&invoice_date_from=2024-01-01&invoice_date_to=2024-06-30&order_by=expiry_date&order_dir=DESC
This builds and returns the correct SQL with values bound safely.
